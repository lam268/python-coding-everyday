Hello,please allow me to  introduce myself again and think about that whether i am fit for your job. you can go to my upwork profile to know me. 

Actually,I am new to upwork and have done some simple tasks about web applications deploying in linux sever. Simply speaking, my ability mainly including two parts, 
parts of this is as a linux system administrator. In this part, I have five years 
experience. The other parts is as a web developer which use python/nodejs for the 
backend and vue.js/html/css for the front end. I've started my programming path in 2007, starting from c and c++ programming. About 2 years ago i've turned my face on Python, which now became my prefered programming language. That mean i can at least read and fix 
most codes.

I think it is not a problem to satisfy your work with my technology, the biggest problem may be time zone. Because, I am in your totally opposite time zone.
